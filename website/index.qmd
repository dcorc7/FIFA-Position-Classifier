title: Classifying Soccer Player Pistions Using FIFA Card Statistics
---

# Introduction

Understanding player roles is fundamental in modern soccer analytics, as they influence scouting decisions, tactical planning, and team building. While traditional positional labels like "defender" or "midfielder" provide a general overview of a player's role, more granular classifications such as "Striker (ST)" or "Right Back (RB)" reveal critical tactical nuances. This project aims to classify soccer players into their on-field roles using neural networks trained on player attributes from EA Sports FIFA video game data (FIFA 15â€“23). Two multi-class classification models were developed: one that assigns players to broad position groups (attacker, midfielder, or defender) and another that classifies them into specific roles, including ST, LW, CM, CB, and others.
